# weather-station-notifications

## About this repository

This is a small go script that fetches notification title and body generated by my [weather station server](https://github.com/Bladesheng/weather-station-backend) and sends it out to all current web push subscriptions saved in the server's database.

I built this in go for 2 reason:

1. To try out go
2. It should be easy to run the compiled binary with something like cron once a day

## Building locally

-   Clone the repo, then create `.env` file

```sh
